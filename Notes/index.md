## Overview

The goal of this course is to give students a technical introduction to current problems in the Philosophy of Mathematics, by looking at the mathematical developments which led to those problems. The importance of certain logical results which affected views about the nature of mathematics will also be emphasized. Even though this is not a logic course, an understanding of certain results will be required, as well as the impact of those results on philosophy.
