# Introduction

* _Instructor_: Audrey Yap

## In this course

Applying *philosophical methods* to mathematics. What are the questions that philosophy of math asks? There a lots of questions,

* What are abstract objects like numbers?
* Why doesn't $\sqrt{-1}$ make sense?
* How was algebra defined?

In this course we're going to focus on the late 19^th and early 20^th century.

## Knowledge and Justification

_definition:_ **Epistemology** is the investigation of what distinguishes justified belief from opinion.

Think about the knowledge we have of Mathematics. For example,

> There are no positive numbers smaller than zero.

Why do we know this? How do we **justify** this knowledge?

* **Perceptual Knowledge**, is based on your perception of the world.
  * e.g., *Why do you think that book is blue?* My eyesight is good, and that's how I perceive is.
  * e.g., *How do you know your dog loves you?* Here are some stories about my dog.

### A Priori & A Posteriori

_definitions:_

* Something that is justified **a priori** uses theoretical deduction rather than from observation or experience (not *empirical*).
* Something that is just justified **a posteriori** using reasoning or knowledge that proceeds from observations or experiences to the deduction of probable causes.

### Mathematics

How would we **justify** things in Mathematics? We **prove** them using proofs.

> Mathematical knowledge is **a priori**.

In other words knowledge about math is not just true because someone said so. It can be independently constructed and deduced.

### The Nature of Numbers

_definition:_ **Onology** examines the nature of ideas.

Numbers are **representations** of the physical world. But how do they relate to the physical world and how do we know how they relate?
