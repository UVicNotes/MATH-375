# Logic

## First-Order Logic

### Predicates 

We write a **predicate** as $F(x)$ for some statement $F$ and some object $x$. For example, we could let $P(x)$ be the statement "$x$ is even" for some object $x$.


## Second-Order Logic

In **Second-order Logic** we can quantify over sets. For example we can write,

$$
    \exists P \exists x ~\neg P(x)
$$

Or, there exists statement $P$ and there exists and object $x$ such that $P$ is false for $x$.
