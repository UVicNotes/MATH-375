# Frege's Logicism

## What is the number one?

Frege examines this question from a number of angles and uses it as an example extensively.

## Frege's Views

Frege disagreed with several prior philosophers of how Mathematics were defined

* [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill), who wanted to base Mathematical knowledge on empirical knowledge.
* [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant), who suggested that there is some innate intuition in our minds that gives us definitions Mathematics.

Frege thought instead the theories of Mathematics should be based on **logic**. He developed a set of rules for this logic which he document in a book, [Begriffsschrift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begriffsschrift).

Much of modern logic is based on Frege's work although [his notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begriffsschrift#Notation_and_the_system) has been mostly replaced by modern alternatives. Frege's system used some [second-order logic](/appx/logic#second-order-logic).
