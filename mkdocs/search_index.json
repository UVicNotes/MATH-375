He developed a set of rules for this logic which he document in a book, \nBegriffsschrift\n.\n\n\nMuch of modern logic is based on Frege's work although \nhis notation\n has been mostly replaced by modern alternatives. Frege's system used some \nsecond-order logic\n.\n\n\nFrege's Logic\n\n\nIf $\\exists x_1 F(x)$ the $\\neg \\exists x_2 F(x)$, or \"If there exists exactly one thing that is $F$ than there are not two thing that are $F$\".\n\n\nProving a Conditional\n\n\nSuppose $\\exists x_1 F(x)$, so $\\exists x(F(x) \\wedge \\neg (F(y) \\wedge x \\neq y))$. Let $a$ be such that $F(a) \\wedge \\neq \\exists y(F(y) \\wedge a \\neq y)$.\n\n\nThis implies $\\neg \\exists y (F(a) \\wedge F(y) \\wedge a \\neq y)$. So $\\neg \\exists y(F(x) \\wedge F(y) \\wedge x \\neq y)$.\n\n\nEquinerousity\n\n\nThe number of $F$'s is the same as the number of $G$'s.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \\exists_5 x F(x) \\wedge \\exists_5 x G(x)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The number of $F$'s is 5 and the number of $G$'s is 5\". We want to write an \nequality\n statement, \"The number of $F$'s $=$ the number of $G$'s\".\n\n\nFrege defined a relationship, \nequinerousity\n. This relation is a bijection between the two quantities. For example the above statement would be equivalent to \"$F$ is \nequinumerous\n with G\".\n\n\ndefinition\n: $F$ is \nequinumerous\n with $G$ when\n\n\n\n\n\n    \\exists R \\left[\n        \\forall x \\left( F(x) \\to \\exists_1 y \\left( R \\left( x,y \\right) \\right) \\wedge G(y) \\right)\n    \\wedge\n        \\forall x \\left( G(x) \\to \\exists_1 y \\left( R \\left( y,x \\right) \\right) \\wedge F(y) \\right)\n    \\right]\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere $R$ is a \nrelation\n from $F$ to $G$. Equinerousity is an \nequivalence relation\n (reflexive, symmetric and transitive).\n\n\nThe Julius Ceaser Problem\n\n\nIs Julius Ceaser the number one?\n\n\nDefining Numbers\n\n\nWe can define numbers as follows,\n\n\n$$\n    \\text{the number of $F$'s} = \\text{the extension of the concept \"equinumerous with $F$\"}\n$$\n\n\nExample\n\n\nLet $F$ be the things on the table. There are three things on the table so the number of $F$'s is $3$. There are many sets equinumerous with $F$, for example\n\n\n\n\nthe set ${1,2,3}$\n\n\nthe set of primary colors\n\n\nthe set of wheels on the triangle\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\n\nWe can define the cardinal numbers as,\n\n\nGiven $n$, $n$ is a number if and only if there is some $F$ such that the number of $F$'s is $n$.\n\n\nCounting Sets\n\n\nHow do we know all the natural numbers exist?\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n    &\"x \\neq x\" ~\\text{has number $0$} \\\\\n    &\"\\text{is identical to $0$}\" ~\\text{has the number $1$} \\\\\n    &\"\\text{is identical to $0$ or $1$}\" ~\\text{has the number $2$} \\\\\n    &~~~~~~~~~~~~\\vdots \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\n\n\n\nSuccession\n\n\nThe number of $F$'s \nsucceeds\n the number of $G$'s if and only if there is an object $x$ falling under $F$ and the number of $G$'s is the number of the concept \"falling under $F$ but not identical to $x$\".",
