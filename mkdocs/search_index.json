He developed a set of rules for this logic which he document in a book, \nBegriffsschrift\n.\n\n\nMuch of modern logic is based on Frege\ns work although \nhis notation\n has been mostly replaced by modern alternatives. Frege\ns system used some \nsecond-order logic\n.\n\n\nFrege\ns Logic\n\n\nIf $\\exists x_1 F(x)$ the $\\neg \\exists x_2 F(x)$, or \nIf there exists exactly one thing that is $F$ than there are not two thing that are $F$\n.\n\n\nProving a Conditional\n\n\nSuppose $\\exists x_1 F(x)$, so $\\exists x(F(x) \\wedge \\neg (F(y) \\wedge x \\neq y))$. Let $a$ be such that $F(a) \\wedge \\neq \\exists y(F(y) \\wedge a \\neq y)$.\n\n\nThis implies $\\neg \\exists y (F(a) \\wedge F(y) \\wedge a \\neq y)$. So $\\neg \\exists y(F(x) \\wedge F(y) \\wedge x \\neq y)$.\n\n\nEquinerousity\n\n\nThe number of $F$\ns is the same as the number of $G$\ns.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \\exists_5 x F(x) \\wedge \\exists_5 x G(x)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of $F$\ns is 5 and the number of $G$\ns is 5\n. We want to write an \nequality\n statement, \nThe number of $F$\ns $=$ the number of $G$\ns\n.\n\n\nFrege defined a relationship, \nequinerousity\n. This relation is a bijection between the two quantities. For example the above statement would be equivalent to \n$F$ is \nequinumerous\n with G\n.\n\n\ndefinition\n: $F$ is \nequinumerous\n with $G$ when\n\n\n\n\n\n    \\exists R \\left[\n        \\forall x \\left( F(x) \\to \\exists_1 y \\left( R \\left( x,y \\right) \\right) \\wedge G(y) \\right)\n    \\wedge\n        \\forall x \\left( G(x) \\to \\exists_1 y \\left( R \\left( y,x \\right) \\right) \\wedge F(y) \\right)\n    \\right]\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere $R$ is a \nrelation\n from $F$ to $G$. Equinerousity is an \nequivalence relation\n (reflexive, symmetric and transitive).\n\n\nThe Julius Ceaser Problem\n\n\nIs Julius Ceaser the number one?\n\n\nDefining Numbers\n\n\nWe can define numbers as follows,\n\n\n$$\n    \\text{the number of $F$\ns} = \\text{the extension of the concept \nequinumerous with $F$\n}\n$$\n\n\nExample\n\n\nLet $F$ be the things on the table. There are three things on the table so the number of $F$\ns is $3$. There are many sets equinumerous with $F$, for example\n\n\n\n\nthe set ${1,2,3}$\n\n\nthe set of primary colors\n\n\nthe set of wheels on the triangle\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\n\nWe can define the cardinal numbers as,\n\n\nGiven $n$, $n$ is a number if and only if there is some $F$ such that the number of $F$\ns is $n$.\n\n\nCounting Sets\n\n\nHow do we know all the natural numbers exist?\n\n\n$$\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n    &\"x \\neq x\" ~\\text{has number $0$} \\\\\n    &\"\\text{is identical to $0$}\" ~\\text{has the number $1$} \\\\\n    &\"\\text{is identical to $0$ or $1$}\" ~\\text{has the number $2$} \\\\\n    &~~~~~~~~~~~~\\vdots \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\n$$\n\n\nSuccession\n\n\nThe number of $F$\ns \nsucceeds\n the number of $G$\ns if and only if there is an object $x$ falling under $F$ and the number of $G$\ns is the number of the concept \nfalling under $F$ but not identical to $x$\n.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nProve that\n\n\n\n\n\n    \\forall x \\forall y \\forall z \\left(\\left( \\mathcal S xz \\wedge \\mathcal S yz \\right) \\to x = y  \\right)\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\nSuppose $\\mathcal S xz$ and $\\mathcal S yz$. Then $z$ is the number of some concept $F$. Then there is something falling under $F$, call it $a$, where $x$ is the number of \nfalling under $F$ but not identical to $a$\n. Then there is also a $b$, where $y$ is the number of \nfalling under $F$ but not identical to $b$\n.\n\n\nFor all $c$\ns falling under $F$ where $c \\neq a$ and $c \\neq b$, let $\\mathcal R cc$. If $a \\neq b$ then $a$ falls under \nfalling under $F$ but not identical to $b$\n and vice versa, so let $\\mathcal R ab$. So since these are equinumerous, $x = y$.\n\n\nNatural Numbers\n\n\nHeredity and Preservation\n\n\nAn concept, $F$, is hereditary with respect to successor or preserved with respect to successor if and only if\n\n\n\n\n\n    \\forall x \\forall y ( ( F(x) \\wedge \\mathcal S xy ) \\to F(y) ).\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbers\n\n\n$K$ is a natural number when\n\n\n\n\n\n    \\forall F \\Bigg( \\bigg( F(0) \\wedge \\forall x \\forall y \\Big( \\big( F(x) \\wedge \\mathcal S xy \\big) \\to F(y) \\Big) \\bigg) \\to F(k) \\Bigg)\n\n\n\n\n\nZero\n\n\nZero is a natural number. \n\n\nProof\n: Take any $F$. Suppose $F(0) \\wedge \\forall x \\forall y \\Big( \\big( F(x) \\wedge \\mathcal S xy \\big) \\to F(y) \\Big)$.

You can take an infinite subset, say the odd natural numbers, and since you can put these in one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers they are of the same cardinality.    The  Continuum Hypothesis  states,   There is no set whose cardinality is between that of the natural numbers, $\\mathbb N$, and the real numbers, $\\mathbb R$.   We say that the continuum hypothesis is  independent  of ZFC, i.e., it cannot be proven or disproven using the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms plus the axiom of choice. This comes from two results,   G\u00f6del showed that we can have ZFC with the continuum hypothesis being  false .  Cohen showed that we can have ZFC with the continuum hypothesis being  true .",
